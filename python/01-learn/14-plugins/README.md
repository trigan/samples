# Plugins: Bundling Hooks, Tools, and State

This tutorial introduces the Strands Agents `Plugin` abstraction. A plugin is a single Python class that bundles `@hook`-decorated lifecycle callbacks, `@tool`-decorated methods, and any plugin-resident state into one installable unit you attach to an agent via `Agent(plugins=[...])`. By the end you will know how to lift any existing `HookProvider` into a `Plugin`, how to expose hook-collected state as a tool the agent itself can call, how to reason about isolated vs. shared plugin instances, and how registration order drives middleware-style composition.

| **Strands Features** | `Plugin`, `@hook`, `@tool`, `BeforeToolCallEvent`, `AfterToolCallEvent`, `BeforeModelCallEvent`, `AfterModelCallEvent`, `cancel_tool`                                |
| **Agent Pattern**    | Single agent with one or more attached plugins; multi-agent composition through registration order                                                                  |
| **Tools**            | Two small in-memory tools (`get_weather`, `lookup_user`) defined in Section 0; one `@tool` (`get_audit_metrics`) bundled inside `MetricsPlugin`                      |
| **Model**            | Claude Haiku 4.5 on Amazon Bedrock (any Strands-supported model works)                                                                                              |

## How It Works

- **Section 1 — Raw hooks → Plugin transition.** The same two-event handler is implemented twice (once as a `HookProvider`, once as a `Plugin`); a captured firing sequence proves the two are observably equivalent.
- **Section 2 — `@tool` inside a plugin.** `MetricsPlugin` collects per-tool call counts via hooks and exposes them through a `get_audit_metrics` tool the agent can call.
- **Section 3 — Plugin state and sharing.** Two agents with their own plugin instances stay isolated; two agents sharing one plugin instance accumulate combined state.
- **Section 4 — Composing multiple plugins.** `SecurityPlugin`, `LoggingPlugin`, and `MetricsPlugin` are stacked in two different orders, demonstrating that registration order drives execution order.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.10 or later.
- An AWS account with [Amazon Bedrock](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/) model access (Claude Haiku 4.5 by default; see the notebook for how to swap models).
- Basic familiarity with Strands Agents ([Quickstart](https://strandsagents.com/latest/documentation/docs/user-guide/quickstart/)). We recommend completing [`13-human-in-the-loop`](../13-human-in-the-loop/) first for hooks fundamentals.

## What You'll Learn

- Lift a `HookProvider` into a `Plugin` with `@hook`-decorated methods.
- Bundle a `@tool` inside a plugin so the agent can introspect plugin-collected state.
- Reason about isolated vs. shared plugin instances across multiple agents.
- Compose multiple plugins and predict execution order from registration order.

## Installation

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then open [plugins-in-strands.ipynb](./plugins-in-strands.ipynb) and run cells top-to-bottom.

## Next Steps

- Build your own plugin that adds a system-prompt fragment plus an audit tool.
- Explore the multi-agent hook events (`BeforeNodeCallEvent`, `AfterNodeCallEvent`) once you move to `Graph` or `Swarm` orchestration.
